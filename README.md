Instead of giving all users access to your complete S3 account, this plugin makes it
possible to give teachers and managers access to a specific S3 folder (bucket).

Multiple instances are supported, you only have to create a IAM user who has read access
to your S3 root folder, but read and write permissions to your S3 bucket.
